      <p class="Introduction">
        Anonymization plays an important role in privacy preserving data
        publishing. In this process of anonymizing the data, a sensitive data
        should not be revealed or linked to the identifier data. While
        publishing data, utmost care should be taken that the data should be
        published in such a manner that it ensures privacy, but here a problem
        arises that if the data is published in highly hidden way, the
        researchers who need data for doing their research cannot get much
        information from this data as some of its contents would be hidden. So,
        our aim is to publish data by keeping in balance the privacy and its
        usefulness for researchers in their research by analysation of the data.

        The Incremental Diversity is obtained by choosing right sensitive
        attributes to produce Masked Microdata Table with lesser number of
        residue records for a given value of K and lesser time complexity.A
        microdata table is basically a raw data obtained from any survey or
        census (for example: details of all students in a class).A Masked
        Microdata Table is nothing but the table obtained from applying various
        anonymity techniques in order bring the efficient model to protect the
        privacy of the data. Disease as Primary, Education as Secondary,
        Employment as Tertiary and Race as Quaternary Sensitive Attributes are
        taken under consideration to obtain efficient Incremental Diversity.
        Sensitive Attributes are the attributes which an individual wants to
        maintain a secret or private. Here Age, Gender, Zip Code is considered
        as Quasi-Identifiers. Quasi-Identifier is an attribute which in
        combination with other attributes can identify an individual uniquely.
        Masked Table is formed by masking and sorting of sensitive attributes
        into various Equivalence Class from Microdata Table. An Equivalence
        Class is a table of records consisting of sensitive attributes and
        quasi-identifier attributes obtained from a microdata table, i.e., it is
        basically a subclass obtained from microdata table. Masking is a process
        to create a face but realistic version of organised sensitive data of an
        individual.

        The anonymity should be performed on the above discussed dataset. The
        output of our project contains various anonymity techniques like
        k-anonymity, l- diversity, anatomy, l-e diversity etc. The issue with
        the following papers was that it was either lacking the multiple
        sensitive attribute or loss of information. According to k-Anonymity
        model it should be noted that the at least k number of records should be
        indistinguishable from other records. This model restricts the
        discussion to single sensitive attribute. Keeping k-Anonymity model in
        mind l-m-d anonymity was introduced in our project for anonymizing the
        microdata table of multiple sensitive attributes by grouping the
        microdata table into equivalence classes and generalizing the
        Quasi-Sensitive Attribute. The most efficient model called anatomy was
        implemented in our project. This model deals with the problem of
        generalization by dividing the microdata table into the two tables
        namely quasi-identifier table and the sensitive attribute table. The
        <abbr title="Quasi-Identifier Table">QT</abbr>contains only
        quasi-identifiers(engages) , whereas
        <abbr title="Sensitive-Attribute Table ">ST</abbr>contains only
        sensitive attributes with their frequency of occurring (count). The
        prominence of anatomy model is that it separates quasi-identifier
        attributes and sensitive attribute leading to the loss of less amount of
        considerable information. The process of anatomy was strong and
        effective but there was a need for diversifying data. The next step was
        to diversify the microdata table. The first step is to look for the
        sensitive attribute group for higher number of sensitive values (it is
        defined by the user). The sensitive attribute containing higher number
        of sensitive values (values with high sensitivity) is considered as
        primary sensitive attribute. If in case the sensitive values are same
        for both attribute then the one with more unique value is considered as
        primary sensitive attribute. Finally, the task was to calculate the
        diversity index for the anonymized table. The degree of diversity is
        calculated using the formula (No. of unique records/total no. of
        records). The aim of our project is to inculcate all the mentioned above
        models and come out with the efficient algorithm called "Incremental
        Diversity".The success of our work is that it outstands other researches
        is that for the maximum number of records the amount of information loss
        is very less .
