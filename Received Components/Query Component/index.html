        It can be a lot of fun simply learning interesting facts and that's
        exactly what this online tool will allow you to do. If you spend even a
        little time, you're going to quickly expand your knowledge with a lot of
        random fun facts. Even if you never share them with others (which you
        likely will at some point), it's fun to know you have that knowledge in
        your head.

        She sat down with her notebook in her hand, her mind wandering to
        faraway places. She paused and considered all that had happened. It
        hadn't gone as expected. When the day began she thought it was going to
        be a bad one, but as she sat recalling the day's events to write them
        down, she had to admit, it had been a rather marvelous day.

        It had been her dream for years but Dana had failed to take any action
        toward making it come true. There had always been a good excuse to delay
        or prioritize another project. As she woke, she realized she was once
        again at a crossroads. Would it be another excuse or would she finally
        find the courage to pursue her dream? Dana rose and took her first step.

        Sleep deprivation causes all sorts of challenges and problems. When one
        doesn’t get enough sleep one’s mind doesn’t work clearly. Studies have
        shown that after staying awake for 24 hours one’s ability to do simple
        math is greatly impaired. Driving tired has been shown to be as bad as
        driving drunk. Moods change, depression, anxiety, and mania can be
        induced by lack of sleep. As much as people try to do without enough
        sleep it is a wonder more crazy things don’t happen in this world.
