          The need of protecting the privacy of the data has got an immense
          importance in the society.There are many anonymity model exists
          today,but most of them aim in preservig only single sensitive
          attribute and very few aim in preserving multiple sensitive
          attributes.The Incremental diversity algorithm is able to diversify
          the datafor multiple sensitive attributes and also produce lesser
          quantity of residue records as compared to other diversity model. This
          website discusses about quering a data table and the results obtained
          from the Incremental Diversity model developed by us.
